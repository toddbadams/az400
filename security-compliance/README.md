## Develop a security and compliance plan (10-15%)
### Design an authentication and authorization strategy
- design an access solution (Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM), Azure AD Conditional Access, MFA, Azure AD B2B, etc.)
- implement Service Principals and Managed Identity
- design an application access solution using Azure AD B2C
- configure service connections
### Design a sensitive information management strategy
- evaluate and configure vault solution (Azure Key Vault, Hashicorp Vault)
- manage security certificates
- design a secrets storage and retrieval strategy (KeyVault secrets, GitHub secrets, Azure Pipelines secrets)
- formulate a plan for deploying secret files as part of a release
### Develop security and compliance
- automate dependencies scanning for security (container scanning, OWASP)
- automate dependencies scanning for compliance (licenses: MIT, GPL)
- assess and report risks
- design a source code compliance solution (e.g., GitHub Code scanning, GitHub Secret scanning, pipeline-based scans, Git hooks, SonarQube, Dependabot, etc.)
### Design governance enforcement mechanisms
- implement Azure policies to enforce organizational requirements
- implement container scanning (e.g., static scanning, malware, crypto mining)
- design and implement Azure Container Registry Tasks
- design break-the-glass strategy for responding to security incidents
