# Continuous Delivery (CD) 

The process by which code is built, tested, and deployed to one or more test and production environments. Deploying and testing in multiple environments increases quality. CI systems produce deployable artifacts, including infrastructure and apps. Automated release processes consume these artifacts to release new versions and fixes to existing systems. Monitoring and alerting systems run continually to drive visibility into the entire CD process.
